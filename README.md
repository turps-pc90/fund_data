Fundamentals of Data Analysis Course Work
<hr>

## Note:
tasks.ipynb contains the 5 tasks. 

My project is contained in a separate GitHub repository - [found here](https://github.com/turps-pc90/foda-project/). I inadvertently set up a separate repository for the task and project and rather than losing my commits from merging, I am just pointing to the repository from here.

Before running the notebook, make sure you have the following installed:

Python
Jupyter Notebook

I have saved a requirements.txt file and this can be installed (if necessary) by running:

``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```
